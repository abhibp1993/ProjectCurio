Testing cases and documentation.

The Arduino control accepts continuous inputs for motor speeds, and transmits back the information packet based on configuration. 

To test in various cases.


1. Select the testCase 1/2/3 function to test. 
   Then update the conf.h file according to comment above the selected function implementation.
   Run the code.

2. Alternately, if test is to be done using manual commands, then, the speeds may be transmitted by comma separated 2 values. (FORMAT: 90.87,77.00). Remember to comment out all testcases.
